#Data-Structures

This is an implementation of many data structures and their associated algorithms in data structures using various instantiation patterns and styles. This repo includes Hashtables, Linked Lists, Graphs, Binary Trees, B-Trees, Bloom Filters, Prefix Trees, and more. 

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. I worked on this project with a pair.
